Clickwise.me
------------

Try it out. 

Based on http://www.cogspace.com/clickwise/

The page is a simple input box with an settings dialog. 
Just start typing (you might want to hit enter when you're done, just to make sure it's all there).

Clocktalk is the only implemented dictionary (1:1 mapping). It is incomplete. Some letters will render as grey boxes. The resulting image is a png file which is totally save-able. 

Developers
----------

Working on a clean API for clickwise, please bear with me!

A scriptlet to scan a page/content and render inline based on css settings will be coming at some point.

What's next
-----------

* A developer api
* Page-parser
* Audio rendering (with various settings)
